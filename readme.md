# Coding Quiz challenge

## Description

This week4 end challenge is to create a functioning coding quiz web api page.

Getting things in order and making a sense/feel of the html & css pages was one thing, that's not the difficult part. But after trying endlessly to make a sense of javascripting to get somewhere and reach absolutely no where, sadly the page is not functional despite the code's presence.

Unlike the scrolling button javacript (2 challenges back) that i was able to understand and properly and joyfully implement, after a while of trying absolutely nothing started making any sense to me anymore. As such, my sincerest appologies on this assessment being as unfinished and bad as it is.

At this moment absolutely everything, even the easiest of things...
